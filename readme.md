# Transformer From Scratch - Translation

This project demonstrates how to build a Transformer model from scratch for language translation tasks. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art NLP models.

## Introduction
This repository contains code to build and train a Transformer model for translating text from one language to another. The implementation is done from scratch using PyTorch, providing a clear understanding of the inner workings of the Transformer architecture. The goal is to offer an educational resource for those interested in learning about the Transformer model and its applications in NLP.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-from-scratch.git
cd transformer-from-scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and pip installed on your system. The `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary libraries such as PyTorch, NumPy, and others.

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the model, prepare your dataset and run the training script:
```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```
- `--data_path`: Path to your training dataset.
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `--batch_size`: Size of each training batch.

### Translating Text
To translate text using a pre-trained model, use the following command:
```bash
python translate.py --model_path /path/to/your/model --input_text "Hello, world!"
```
- `--model_path`: Path to your pre-trained model.
- `--input_text`: Text you want to translate.

## Model Architecture
The Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both made up of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. Key components include:
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of each token in the sequence.
- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes the inputs to each layer to stabilize and accelerate training.
- **Residual Connections**: Helps in training deep networks by allowing gradients to flow through the network directly.

## Training
The training process involves:
1. **Preparing the Dataset**: Tokenization, padding, and creating batches.
2. **Defining the Model Architecture**: Implementing the encoder, decoder, and attention mechanisms.
3. **Setting Up the Optimizer and Loss Function**: Using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
4. **Training the Model**: Running the training loop over multiple epochs, adjusting weights to minimize the loss.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using BLEU score or other relevant metrics:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/your/model --data_path /path/to/your/dataset
```
- `--model_path`: Path to your trained model.
- `--data_path`: Path to your evaluation dataset.

## Results
Include a section to showcase the results of your model, including training loss, validation accuracy, and example translations. Visualize the training process with plots of loss and accuracy over epochs. Provide qualitative results by showing example translations compared to reference translations.
